## Introduction

This coil was originally built Fall/Winter of 2011 after outgrowing the 4"
secondary that I had built nearly 10 years prior. It was originally designed to
handle between 3kW-10kW of input power, with 10kW being the absolute upper
maximum. It would be powered initially by a single 12kV PT, with the intent of
eventually stepping up to pole transformer power as other components were
acquired. The decade of experience running Tesla coils had taught me a few
things about do's/do not's, and some features that I wanted in a new coil.
Particularly: portability, modularity, flexibility, adequate primary-secondary
spacing, more robust RF ground and topload connections, and better overall
aesthetics.

## Design

The secondary, topload, primary assembly, and base can all be broken down
separately to ease transporation and storage. The base is large enough to
enclose the newly built 12" ARSG and MMC capacitors. The secondary has
absolutely no metal penetrating the coil form or end caps. The end caps are
HDPE discs held in place with nylon bolts. Topload connection is done via 3"
SCH40 PVC flanges and various lengths of pipe to set the topload heigh, or
allow for topload stacking.

### Secondary

The secondary coil form was sanded, coated with polyurethane, then wound by
hand with the assistance of a corded drill run off a variac to reduce the
speed. After winding, it was coated with may layers of polyurethane, then
allowed to slowly rotate while curing.

To mount the secondary, a 1/2"-13 hex nut is captured in a block of HDPE
(epoxied together), then bolted to the end cap with nylon screws. A 1/2"-13
bolt with wingnut and washer can then be used from the bottom of the primary
deck to securely hold the secondary in place, while allowing the secondary to
be quickly removed for storage and transportation. The bolt and nut are not
electrically connected to anything, and are effectively insulated from inside
the coil form.

topped with a 3" PVC pipe flange with more nylon screws.

### Base

### Toroid

The toroid is a piece of 8" corrugated ABS drain pipe, covered with may layers
of wide masking tape the smooth it out, then mounted over a plywood center
disc. A piece of copper wire is embedded in the inside upper edge to provide
solid electrical connection to each piece of foil tape (arcing between adjacent
pieces of tape was noted in other toroids, this wire totally eliminates this
problem). Finally, a single piece of tape is placed around the outer edge to
help smooth the outer diameter and reduce sharp edges caused by the pieces of
tape underneath.

Performance was better with the single large topload, despite requiring
off-axis inductance to bring the system in tune.

942C series capacitors is very reflective, so the few caps that are showing
high temperatures may just be reflecting the body heat of the cameraman.

### Off-axis L

As a result of the high inductance, low frequency secondary, an off-axis coil
is required in series with the primary to bring the system in tune with the
0.03uF capacitor. This was originally 12AWG THHN wound on a 3" PVC form, but
this got quite hot even during short runs. In September 2018, this was replaced
with a hand-wound coil of 8AWG wire, which still got quite hot but only during
1min+ runs.

The thermal image shows the coil of wire after almost a minute of continuous
high power operation.

## Performance

The coil continuously throws 6 foot power arcs to ground, currently limited by
proximity of the fluorescent lights and rafters. This is with lightly pegging
the 25A ammeter in the power controller, with ~280V in (stepped up via a 1256D
variac). An outdoor run will be conducted soon once a NEMA 6-50P to L6-30R
power adapter is assembled and the weather cooperates.

Some of the first runs at ~3kW from a single 12kV PT.
