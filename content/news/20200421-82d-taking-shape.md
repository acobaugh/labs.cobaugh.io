I just updated the [Model 82D](/hv/tesla/82D) and [10x47 ring toroid](/hv/tesla/10x47-ring-toroid) pages with new photos and information. The 82D coil is coming along, with the secondary and toroid now complete. Final design work is nearly complete on the new water-cooled primary and base. I've chosen to implement a remote DC power supply with precharge, discharge, EMI filtering, voltage doubling, and voltage and current monitoring. This will have the advantage of allowing me to use much smaller wiring between the operator and the coil. The new power controller is intended to be run off of 240V@50A and supply up to 12kVA of 680VDC power.

More to come later.
